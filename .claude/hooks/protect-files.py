"""plinth -- .claude/hooks/protect-files.py (T-P1, PLINTH_SPEC §2.5)

Ported from Gearfall's S-22 hook. A PreToolUse hook on Edit|Write. It
refuses a write to a protected path at the moment the agent attempts it,
rather than at commit time, and it says what the correct route is instead
of only saying no.

THE CONTRACT, and the reason this file exists rather than a shell one-liner:

    A PreToolUse hook BLOCKS by exiting with code 2 and writing its reason
    to STDERR. Exit 1 does not block. A reason written to STDOUT is
    IGNORED on exit 2. Get either wrong and the hook runs, prints nothing
    the agent can see, and permits the write -- a guard that silently does
    nothing, which is worse than no guard at all.

That is why guards/protect-files.test.ts asserts EXIT CODES, not message
text: a test over the message alone passes on a hook that blocks nothing.

FAILS OPEN. Any malformed payload, unreadable stdin, or internal error
exits 0. A bug in this file must never become an unintended global write
ban -- CI and the fresh-context review (§2.5, §7) remain the hard gate,
and this is a second line in front of them, never a replacement.

NO BYPASS TOKEN. A human, or a planning session deliberately amending the
doc of record, proceeds by editing outside the agent tool (any editor, or
`cat > file`), or by removing this hook's registration from
.claude/settings.json for that session. There is deliberately no magic
value that unlocks it from inside a payload: a guard with a password in
the codebase is not a guard.

ACTIVATION. Claude Code reads .claude/settings.json when a session STARTS.
Adding the registration mid-session does not arm it. So: this guard is live
from the NEXT session onward, and guards/protect-files.test.ts -- which
drives the script as a subprocess -- is what proves the logic in CI
regardless of session state. If you need to confirm the registration is
armed in a running session, attempt a write to a protected path and expect
the block; if the write succeeds, restart the session rather than assuming.

Stdlib only. This repo has no Python dependency chain and must not grow one.
