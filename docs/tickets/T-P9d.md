# T-P9d — appropriate demos and continuous screen edges

Document of record: PLINTH_SPEC §2, §4.1/P-9, §4.4/P-6/P-7,
§4.6/P-13, §4.8/P-14, §7. Research: T-P9d-research F1–F9.
Builder: Codex (backend model identifier not exposed).
Owner feedback expands polish beyond T-P9c's original no-screen-shader scope;
this separate ticket/PR records that boundary, stacked on PR #27.

## Scope

1. Restore exact approved landscape demo; keep portrait on phone and landscape
   on all wide classes. Cache/mount synchronously, with explicit disposal and
   recovery ownership. A user image supersedes the demo bank permanently.
2. After owner review (F7), phone/tablet/laptop/card demo startup/device/preset
   choices show Contain; browser keeps Cover in the actual Fit control.
   Preserve user-image behavior and explicit shared-state settings.
3. Replace stochastic edge coverage with deterministic SDF alpha testing and
   existing SMAA. Compare native edge captures; keep opaque physical screen,
   SDF corner masks, screen tone/glare and all existing acceptance thresholds.
4. Match workspace gutters to preset/solid background. Verify desktop framing
   without changing sidebar/export layout. Diagnose red diff overlays separately.
5. Refresh thumbnails; capture all20 pairs, desktop panel, native PNGs and edge
   comparisons. Clearly label real renders versus diagnostics.

## Acceptance / write set

Use F1–F9's write set. Add lifecycle/demo-choice tests and a focused real-browser
regression for image switching, upload preservation, neutral clean-white,
matching workspace gutters and non-hashed edge shader. Extend the existing
first-ready guard to both phone and tablet with their exact source dimensions
and fit, keeping every warm-up/content/order assertion (F6). Seed regressions.
Run npm run ci and build before push; preserve old tests. Actual native PNGs,
new CI PG/PNG and independent review remain required. Baselines remain read-only;
no bless, merge, deploy or competition submission.

## Implementation evidence

The following records the first reviewed candidate. F7 below supersedes its
tablet/laptop/card Cover defaults; the portrait/landscape assets stay identical.

- Restored landscape bytes from bdebd02: 2880x1800, 259141 bytes,
  SHA256 72128b4a216b772a1215424906b321e1f9472b1e2165fcb144e29ef81f97d585.
  Portrait remains byte-identical. Cover fills wide demo openings and can crop
  outer screenshot content; the actual Fit control reports Cover. User images
  and explicit shared-link fit do not receive this demo-only preset override.
- All 193 pre-existing unit tests passed after implementation; four added
  lifecycle/settings cases pass (selection, restore, once-only disposal,
  permanent user override, pending/failed loader, explicit shared fit).
- Three focused browser guards pass (41.22 s). Separate seeded runs fail on:
  restored alphaHash (12 dark/light alternations along the sampled edge), wrong
  portrait selection on tablet (845 instead of 2880), old green-grey gutters
  ([233,236,229] instead of [233,235,238]). No old guard assertion is weakened.
  The edge probe allows at most two continuous-rim crossings, accounting for
  the normative front camera's 5-degree elevation and perspective slope.
- Final real UI capture: 20 device/scene pairs, desktop/mobile screenshots,
  six real 2x PNG downloads; success=true and errors=[]. Native phone export
  2160x2700; other exports 3840x2160. This is not an enlarged contact sheet.
- Actual card/clean-white output is neutral; pixelmatch .diff.png files are
  diagnostic red difference overlays. Scene colors were not changed.
- Four thumbnails regenerated. Workspace side gutters match preset/solid
  backgrounds; canvas outer CSS shadow removed, panel layout preserved.
- Initial full CI exposed the stale tablet-first-frame expectation of the
  portrait demo and former mount API. F6 records its exact fixture migration,
  with additional phone coverage and all original readiness checks retained.
- Expanded first-frame probe: both positive cases pass (34.64 s); a seeded
  portrait-on-tablet defect fails on 845x1862 versus 2880x1800 (45.70 s).
  The initial full CI was interrupted after finding the stale fixture; it is
  not counted as a pass. The complete final run below includes all guards.
- Full local npm run ci PASSED on
  63e3a5f56cb0f2cd84fa87628130bb3f937aa91a (tree
  452ff0f1ecf8ffdf8920456fd8af2dd92539ec9b): 85/85 guards in 13 files
  (1089.19 s), TypeScript, 197/197 units in 28 files (11.61 s). Final build
  also passes; the existing 700 kB chunk warning remains (705.06 kB output).
  Linux, Node 24.19.0, Chromium 153.0.8010.12 / SwiftShader. These timings
  are acceptance execution time, not a target-device performance benchmark.
  Only this ticket changes after that tested commit. Runtime,
  public assets and capture script remain identical to the captured 02ebd48.
- Cloud CI/PG/PNG and independent review remain pending. Owner did not bless
  the prior candidate set; fixtures remain unchanged. No merge or deployment.

## F7 — uncropped three-device follow-up

Owner identified cropped left/right content in tablet/laptop/card. Their demo
defaults now use Contain, preserving the full 2880x1800 image without stretching;
small top/bottom margins are intentional. Phone and browser defaults are kept.
Existing default-Fit expectations are updated in place with all actions and
readiness checks retained. Coverage includes both explicit shared Fit values
and image bounds/aspect within the three real screen rectangles.

- Actual UI capture: all 20 device/scene pairs and six 2x downloads completed;
  success=true, errors=[]. The three corrected exports are 3840x2160 and were
  visually inspected. All eight phone/browser scene PNGs are byte-identical
  to the earlier captures. Two affected composition thumbnails are refreshed.
- Restoring the old Cover default in an isolated copy fails the geometric
  containment assertion: fitted width 0.256 m exceeds the tablet's 0.232 m
  screen. The seed was removed; four positive demo lifecycle/settings tests
  pass. The shared-state check retains both explicit Contain and Cover cases.
- Full npm run ci PASSED on ad2e79cae537ef59e2818ef35de6851e91d6088e,
  tree 627e8bdf640c3409cc1191fd1b5607662e08ca82: 85/85 guards in 13 files
  (968.09 s), TypeScript and 197/197 units in 28 files (10.74 s). Build passes
  with the existing 700 kB warning (705.06 kB output). Only this ticket's
  evidence changes after that tested commit. No baseline changes or bless;
  the new published head still needs matching cloud checks and fresh review.

## F8/F9 — independent review fixes

Review 5218869833 on 01a9372 returned FIXUP. Restrict matching workspace
backgrounds to editor UI so pure PG transparent captures retain clear alpha.
Keep the active demo resize notice synchronized across device, composition,
reset and shared-state changes, alongside existing input/recovery messages.
Add real-browser regressions in guards/demo-edges.test.ts; first run on the
unfixed head fails on [233,235,238,255] instead of clear RGBA and on the missing
2048 px demo notice. This extends coverage without changing old assertions.
The third review finding remains: owner baseline bless and acceptance of the
stacked dependencies are outstanding. Final validation is recorded below.

### F8/F9 validation (2026-09-16)

- Both new tests fail on the unchanged pre-fix implementation: opaque clear
  corner [233,235,238,255], and empty downscale note after selecting Tablet.
  All five positive demo-edge guards pass after the fixes (87.51 s), including
  input error preservation, user resize notice, reset/composition and fresh
  shared-link hydration. The cap of 2048 is a browser capability simulation.
- First full CI reported a failure in the existing `T-P9 recovery defers latest
  navigation and PG ignores hash and shortcuts` test (67.205 s). The remaining
  run was interrupted and is not counted as a pass. Without code/test changes,
  that focused test passed (36.229 s). The cause of the first failure has not
  been established; it is disclosed for independent review. No assertion,
  timeout or tolerance was changed and no test was skipped in the full rerun.
- Complete repeated `npm run ci` PASSED on
  b549a7fca7310e585d2acf9d24991211e505746b, tree
  108b4de7dcdc26daa63daeb4e8ce6406b889c85a: 87/87 guards in 13 files
  (1101.20 s), TypeScript, 197/197 units in 28 files (11.30 s). Production
  build passes with the existing 700 kB warning (705.21 kB output). Linux,
  Node 24.19.0, Chromium 153.0.8010.12 / SwiftShader. Only this ticket's
  evidence changes after the tested commit.
- New-head cloud CI/PG/PNG and independent review remain required. The
  previous review's baseline/dependency finding remains open. No local raw
  screenshot/log evidence upload, baseline modification/bless or merge.
